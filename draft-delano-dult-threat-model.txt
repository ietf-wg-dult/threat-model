                        Draft DULT Threat Model
                 draft-delano-dult-threat-model-latest

Abstract

   Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to
   locate items.  These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced
   tracking network in which devices belonging to other network users
   (e.g., phones) report which tags they see and their location, thus
   allowing the owner of the tag to determine where their tag was most
   recently seen.  While there are many legitimate uses of these tags,
   they are also susceptible to misuse for the purpose of stalking and
   abuse.  A protocol that allows others to detect unwanted location
   trackers must be incorporate an understanding of the unwanted
   tracking landscape today.  This document provides a threat analysis
   for this purpose.
